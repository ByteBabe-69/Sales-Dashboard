## 📌 Features & Insights

- 🌍 **Region-wise Sales & Profit Overview**
- 🛒 **Top Performing & Underperforming Products**
- 📆 **Monthly Sales Trends**
- 📈 Key KPIs: Total Revenue, Profit, Quantity Sold, and Profit Margin
- 🧠 **YOY (Year-over-Year)** comparison for strategic insights

## 🔍Insights
Payment Mode Insights:
1. We observed that the highest volume of payments is made through Cash on Delivery (COD).
2. Online Payments come in second, and the least amount of payments is made through Card Payments.
3. If you have access to credit card details, you can analyze which company’s card is being used. This allows you to run targeted offers on those cards to gain an advantage.

Regional and Segment Insights:
1. In terms of regions, the majority of sales come from the West, contributing around 33% of total sales.
2. Within that region, you can identify which specific state contributes the most—likely California.
3. When you look at sales by customer segment, the Consumer segment accounts for the highest number of sales.

Monthly Sales and Profit Patterns:
1. The sales figures show that the highest sales occur in December, followed by November and then September.
2. However, the profit peaks are a bit different: the highest profits are observed in October and December, with an additional profit spike in March.

Category and Shipping Insights:
1. From the detailed data, you can determine which product category performs the best and see which shipping mode (or shift mode) is most preferred by customers.

Overall Performance (Last Two Years):
- Over the past two years, the project recorded more than 22,000 orders.
- Total sales amounted to 1.6 million, and the profit was 175,000.
- On average, deliveries are completed within four days from the shipment date.
